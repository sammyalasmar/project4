The collection
<li>• Is Art Palestine International's entire collection available online? 

No. The AIF's preservation, digitization and documentation activities are ongoing. Users will be notified when new items are published online.</li>

<li>• Is it OK to use images of items from the AIF collection?

Yes, images can be used free of charge for personal research and artistic use. If an artwork using images from the AIF collection is sold, 10 % of the proceeds should be paid to the AIF. Please refer to the Image Use Policy for detailed information.

For commercial use, permission must be sought and a fee will apply.</li>

<li>• What if I need an image that is not available online, or not available in high enough resolution?

You can write to us at imaging@arabimagefoundation.org</li>

<li>• Do you loan items in your collection?

Original items can be loaned to institutions and museums that can ensure adequate environments in terms of security, climate control, light control, and suitable handling.

Existing reproductions of items in the collection can be loaned to spaces with uncontrolled environments. The AIF can also handle requests for new reproductions, for a fee.

Image use
Please begin by consulting our Image Use Policy for detailed information regarding image use.</li>

<li>• I'm not sure if my intended image use is commercial or non-commercial.

Commercial use, as defined by Creative Commons, means "reproducing a work in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation".

Please consult our Image Use Policy for more information.</li>

<li>• Why are some images on the AIF's website not licenced under Creative Commons?

Typically for one of the following reasons:

- The work is under copyright or the copyright status is unclear.

- There are issues concerning privacy.

- Contractual restrictions were specified by the item's donor or photographer.

- The AIF is yet to produce a digital image of the item that meets its standards for reproduction.</li>

<li>• Who owns the copyright to the images in your collection?

Copyright status varies from item to item and is mentioned on each item record page.</li>

<li>• I've downloaded an image from your website. What is the largest size at which I can print it?

The maximum print output size is: 20x30 cm at 72dpi

To request a larger file, please submit an image request via your online space.</li>

<li>• Can I reproduce a detail of an image?

Yes, providing you identify the image as a detail in the caption or credit.

<li>•Do I need to inform you before reproducing an image from your collection?

The AIF is interested in studying and following the journeys of the items in its collection.

We would very much like to receive information about the context of reproduction and dissemination of an image. All such information will be added to an item's biography, and displayed on the item record page.

We would also appreciate a complimentary copy of your work (in digital and physical format) as a donation to our Library and Documentation Centre.</li>

<li>• I'd like to reproduce an image from your website that isn't part of your collection.

Please contact us: hello@arabimagefoundation.org</li>

<li>• As an artist, if I use an image from the AIF collection as part of a work and then sell it, does this constitute commercial use?

Yes. As compensation, we request that you donate 10% of the proceeds to the AIF.</li>

<li>• What does the take-down policy in your image use policy mean?

Copyright owners of photographs, or individuals portrayed in a photograph or otherwise possessing a connection to a photograph are invited to contact the AIF if they come across a reproduction of the photograph, reproduced in such a way as to be in breach of copyright laws, or potentially contravening privacy laws, or defamatory, or lacking sensitivity to issues of context.

In such an event, the AIF takes responsibility for making initial contact with the individual or institution responsible for the reproduction and requesting the removal of the image from its context, or in the case of already produced works, the non-circulation of said work.
